### What I learned

This project taught me a lot about creating interactive UI components with modern CSS. My biggest learning was how to implement a hover effect that displays an icon over an image using Tailwind's **`group-hover`** utility. This allowed me to create a clear and dynamic interaction without writing complex CSS.

I also learned the importance of organizing images and other assets in a scalable way. While this project only used a few images, I made sure to structure my code in a way that would be easy to scale.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue focusing on scalability. Specifically, I'll be working on:

- **Using JavaScript Objects or JSON:** I want to get better at structuring card data in a separate file using objects or JSON. This will make it easier to manage and update content without touching the main component code.
- **Image Utility Scripts:** I'll practice using utility scripts with **`import.meta.glob`** to automatically import images. This will prevent me from having to manually import every image, making the process much more efficient and scalable.
